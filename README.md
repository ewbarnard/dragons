There's a strong tendency toward "gate keeping" right now in the 2020s. Senior developers warn "there be dragons" while
announcing a "hands off" policy toward the crucial areas of the code base. You and I need to get past that. Where's the
fun when you can't touch the dragons? The joy's in _experiencing_ software development, dragons and all.

## About Edward Barnard

Ed has experienced two 20-year careers in software development. He soldered together his first computer from a handful
of resistors, diodes, switches, and lights in 1968 at age 10. He taught himself FORTRAN IV two years later. High School
brought BASIC. College introduced Algol, assembly language, and Pascal. Ed's first career was writing operating system
software for Cray Research and the world's fastest computers. His second career has been web software development for
countless clients, companies, and projects. Ed and wife Susan have a new hobby: camping the Minnesota winter, allowing
them to get back outdoors with no mosquitoes.
